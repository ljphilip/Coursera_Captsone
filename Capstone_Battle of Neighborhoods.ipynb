With the blossoming number of apartments across the city, the choice of apartment to rent is to be determined not just by the proximity to the workplace but the quality of the neighbourhood. This project will cluster together similar neighborhoods based on the popular venue categories in each neighbourhood and map the various apartments in these neighborhoods.\n",
